		<h2>Level 2 Heading....</h2>
		<p>Tolstoy began writing War and Peace in 1863, the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate. 
		In September of that year, he wrote to Elizabeth Bers, his sister-in-law, asking if she could find any chronicles, diaries or records 
		that related to the Napoleonic period in Russia. He was dismayed to find that few written records covered the domestic aspects of Russian life at that time, 
		and tried to rectify these omissions in his early drafts of the novel.[8] The first half of the book was written and named "1805". 
		During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. Tolstoy wrote in a letter to Afanasy Fet that what he had written in War and Peace is also said by Schopenhauer in The World as Will and Representation. 
		However, Tolstoy approaches "it from the other side."</p>
